# AdventOfCode2024

I'm going to attempt to use embedded C++ this year. The platform I've chosen is the M5 Cardputer, which has a fairly generous amount of RAM as these things go (512kB). Hopefully that will be enough.

So far, I've been able to solve everything on the Cardputer except:

Day 11 part 2

Day 16 both parts

Day 21 both parts

Day 22 part 2
